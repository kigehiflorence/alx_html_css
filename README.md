# 📱 CSS Advanced Project — ALX SE

This is the **CSS Advanced project** for the ALX Software Engineering program. The task was to translate a detailed Figma design into a responsive and styled web page using **HTML** and **CSS** only.

## 🎨 Project Description

The project aims to replicate a Figma-based design precisely by:
- Structuring a semantic HTML page.
- Applying advanced, clean, maintainable CSS styling.
- Making the layout **responsive** — switching to a mobile version when the viewport width is `480px` or less.
- Handling hover/active states for links and buttons.

## 📎 Project Files

- `index.html` — Contains the main structure of the page.
- `styles.css` — Holds all the custom CSS styles.
- `README.md` — Project documentation.

- **Responsive layout:** Switch to a mobile layout at `480px` screen width or less.
- CSS should be simple, clean, and reuse selectors where possible.
